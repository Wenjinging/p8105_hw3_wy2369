# Problem 1

### Load the dataset

Using this code chunk to load data from `p8105.datasets`.

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

### Write a short description of the dataset

This dataset contains **1384617** rows and **15** columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order.

Variables include identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in
which each product was added to the cart. There are several order-level
variables, describing the day and time of the order, and number of days
since prior order. Then there are several item-specific variables,
describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department
(e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits),
and whether the item has been ordered by this user in the past.

In total, there are **39123** products found in **131209** orders from
**131209** distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are **134** aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

### Make a plot the number of items ordered in each aisle

The plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, which n is
more than 10000. Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

### Make a table showing the three most popular items

The three most popular items in aisles are
**`baking ingredients`**,**`dog food care`**, and
**`packaged vegetables fruits`**, and the table includes the number of
times each item is ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

### Make a table showing the mean hour that Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered.

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2

### Load, tidy, and wrangle the data

The dataset includes all originally observed variables and values. It
includes a weekday vs weekend variable and encodes data with reasonable
variable classes.

Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many
observations, etc).

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(
    day_type = if_else(day %in% c("Sunday","Saturday"),"weekend","weekday"))
```

    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day

### 

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.
